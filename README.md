# Simple Quiz App

A straightforward quiz application built with MIT App Inventor. Test your knowledge with a series of questions and receive instant feedback on your answers.

## Overview

The Simple Quiz App presents questions sequentially. Users input their answers via text, and the app verifies if the answer is correct. It's designed for simple question-and-answer formats.

## Features

* **Question Display:** Presents questions from a predefined list.
* **Answer Input:** Allows users to type their answers.
* **Answer Checking:** Compares the user's input to the correct answer.
* **Feedback:** Indicates whether the submitted answer is correct or incorrect.
* **Question Navigation:** Move to the next question in the list.
* **Cycles Through Questions:** The quiz can loop through questions if the list is exhausted.

## Requirements

To build and run this application, you will need:

* An account on the MIT App Inventor website (appinventor.mit.edu).
* A computer with internet access.
* An Android device or emulator for testing the application.
* Any required image files if the app is intended to display pictures with questions (the blocks suggest this, though the UI doesn't explicitly show an image component).

## Building the Application

Refer to the `step-to-step_guide.md` file for detailed instructions on how to recreate this application in MIT App Inventor. You will need to customize the questions, answers, and potentially image files within the blocks.

## How to Use

1.  Launch the application on your Android device.
2.  The first question will be displayed.
3.  Read the question and type your answer into the text box provided.
4.  Tap the **Submit** button to check your answer. The app will display if your answer was "Correct!" or "Incorrect!".
5.  Tap the **Next** button to proceed to the next question. The answer field and feedback will be cleared.
6.  Continue submitting answers and tapping "Next" to go through all the questions.
